# System Dates

> Exposes the internal creation and modification dates of an entry (read-only) in the format of a normal date field.

## INSTALLATION

1. Upload `system_dates_field` to your Symphony `/extensions` folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Fields: System Dates", choose Enable/Install from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

3. You can now add the "Date: System Created" and "Date: System Modified" fields to your sections.

## OPTIONS

1. Can show date only or date with time (format is defined by the configuration of Symphony)
2. Can display dates as relative time, i.e. X minutes/hours ago.

## USAGE

Functions similar to the normal Date field in Symphony, however it does not allow editing of the value it contains, instead exposing the entry Creation Date and entry Modification Date as stored internally by Symphony.

## NOTES

TODO: Add Grouping for Data Sources.
